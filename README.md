# Setuo

This project is managed by [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/). Download it first.

- `poetry install`
- `poetry run python fuzzy_logic.py`

# Note

This uses a custom version of the scikit-fuzzy library that can get the visualization of variables, instead of just directly showing them.

As such, make sure to use the version of scikit-fuzzy from the link in `pyproject.toml` and not the main repository
